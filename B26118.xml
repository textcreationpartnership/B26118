         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIs remarkable, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how much GOD looks after the purity of his Worship, which most men think is but some mens stiffnesse, minding singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and punctilo's, more then the main. Tis ill to go to build without a foundation, and tis but ruinous to rest in a bottom without a top; a man shall dwell but coldly, in a house without a roof. If Gods house want but its glory, it may want its defence, as much as if it wanted its being, as to felicity in this world. When <hi>Samuel</hi> did something about cleansing GODS worship, GOD did something against the <hi>Philistims:</hi> What he would have done he could not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the perversenesse of the people. In <hi>Davids</hi> time a full
<pb facs="tcp:204719:7"/> Reformation was made and then GOD fully brought down all their Enemies,<note place="margin">See the last English Annot in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3 They did reform but in part, and so were delivered but in part by <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Philistims,</hi> and all else round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Upon this subject, thou wilt finde this little piece spend it self.</p>
            <p>I have, <hi>Reader,</hi> endeavoured to be thy spye, in reference to that good Land of Ordinance, which flowes with milk and hony: As to depth of discerning and judging in the Mysteries of Gospel-Worship, I confesse my self very weak, and can onely say as <hi>Caleb</hi> when he came back, from espying the Land, that <hi>I have brought thee word as it was in my heart,</hi> Indeed I have, indeed I have beloved <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> As I have learned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb facs="tcp:204719:7"/> I have spoken; It may be with more plain-dealing, then some other of my Brethren who have wrote of this Subject, but take that ingenuously as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection of my Spirit, as one deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed with the weight of these things, and the dangerous averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this poor people, among whom I have more been and more seen, then some others of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have done. I write, <hi>Reader,</hi> against things, not persons: All the LORDS People in <hi>Scotland</hi> are very dear unto me, with one little one of whom I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my self, because truly their little Ones are as <hi>David</hi> in some things, for affection and sobriety, though in other things, yet dark. In Persons of higher growth, I have observed eminent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

            <p>All that I have heavy upon my heart, respecting both the one and the other, is, that as to Church order, they are in an ill vessell, which cannot possible live, in such stormes as now beat upon it, from Heaven, and from the Saints, and therefore I could wish that all the godly were out on't. The love of this hath constrained me to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travell, even beyond my strength, that great thoughts of heart, against what the great GOD is now adoing, may fall, and GOD▪ People no more fal with that whic<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Caleb</hi> takes much notice that he was kept alive, when so many of his brethren were slain, <hi>And now behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said these fourty five years, whilst the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<pb facs="tcp:204719:9"/> wandred in the wildernesse, Josh. 14.7.</hi> Surely, Reader, 'tis not for nought, that the Lord hath kept thee and I alive, in all this time wherein our brethren have been slain on every hand of us; much lesse for worse then nought, are we left; to live up that, for which they are dead. What is here offered to thee with the right hand, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do not thou take with the left.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is now held out in the forepart of this Piece (which occasioned the second) was first offered by the Author, in the very love and faithfulness of his spirit, in a Lecture at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It was then frowardly entertained by some, roughly by many, and yet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired to the Press by others. At that time with him, the frame of the former hindered the desire of the latter; yet so as he rested in an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a season, wherein the former also would be likely to hear such
<pb facs="tcp:204719:10"/> words, which to some are never sweet till a day of calamity,<note place="margin">Psal. 141.</note> or when their Judges are overthrown. Thus doth the Lord oft times sweeten his truth and sayings, with the bitterness of his doings, and takes out one heat by another. <hi>Jonah</hi> is peevish and hot, and in his heat cannot receive the expostulation of God himself, (and such hath bin the case here) but afterward the suns heat, and the East-wind (both which are Scripture Hieroglyphicks of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction) do beat something into <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi> head,<note place="margin">Jonah 4.</note> and (having Gods own comment) do si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the passion of the Prophet.</p>
            <p>Possibly <hi>Scotlands</hi> vision may come as <hi>Ezekiels,</hi> out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde and the fire.<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> God, afore this testimony was given, had spoken in his wrath to <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Preston</hi> against the grosser, at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> against the finer, and at <hi>Hamilton</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204719:10"/> against the finest oposites of this truth and its interest; and since this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given, he hath gone on to speak the same language from <hi>Enerkethen</hi> to <hi>Worcester.</hi> It may be, some of you the beloved Saints of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (for we cannot but think and call some so, howsoever it hath been taken) may suspect or be willing to search the wretchednesse, poverty, blindnesse and nakednes of your national Church state, and having your ear opened to Gods discipline in the rod, will not in love of your own, stop the ear to this faithfull Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,<note place="margin">Psal 58.</note> or soft and sweet wisperer, as the Hebrew signifies. He is wisely charming you from the corruption, not use of Ordinances. If a loose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, despising those precious things of Heaven, should seize upon you (which God forbid) we should judge it to have more of the venomous adder in it, and more to be resisted and detested,
<pb facs="tcp:204719:11"/> then any thing in your present state. If this good man be not a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to you all, yet we believe, he will be so to Christ, whom his soul loves, and in whom also you are the desire of his soul. The first part of his Work may put you upon enquiry, whether you have dealt kindly with Christ, to obtrude as imperious and selfish Guardians or Tutors, such a spouse upon him, as is not according to his choyce, minde or l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ep to the wolves) doth tell them, that almost nine parts of ten in their flock are not sheep, not fit (say they) of civill, much lesse (say we) of Spirituall priveledges; and then they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a herd or drove, then a flock, for few (as the shepherds themselves think now their driving power ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) will be willing to be kept by them,
<pb facs="tcp:204719:11"/> nay many (as they already know) do turn again, and would gladly rend them. The keeping of such for their flock, may be as unsafe to the good Ministers as it is unprofitable to the people (both good and bad) and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to Christ.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, it will not onely be a right done to Christ, but also mercy to themselves and the people, to hearken to the voyce of this testimony in the first part thereof; and that will better dispose to the reception of the second, as a necessary preservative of the first, and give a bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But while (not the godly, but) the bulk of the Nation is the Church, it must have Officers and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions accordingly, and then no less can be expected, then that the generality of the Officers &amp; members, be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord and his people, in point of Gospel-communion. Nor is it
<pb facs="tcp:204719:12"/> any wonder, that those few Saints that are lost and drowned among the rest of the Ministers and people, be an abomination to the greatest part of such a Church. If such Saints will not, but in company of this multitude walk with God, or his people, what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-communion can there be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? As for the purging of this body, we suspect it to be (as the body) suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and a diversion from a reall duty: For, beside what we apprehend, how impossible it is, that the far lesser number (retaining their present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution) should regularly cast out the greater part therefrom; we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our experience, that the worser and greater part, is more able and willing to a formall ejection of the better, then on the contrary: And therefore this ten years talk of the lips (about purging) hath tended only to penury,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.</note> and the last years have been further from
<pb facs="tcp:204719:12"/> that work then the former.</p>
            <p>But we may now hope, some more reall truth and course will take place. God hath found <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> in a prison, and asleep, between two armed Keepers, the Kirk, (so called) and the State, and bound with two chaines. May there not a light have now shone in the Prison, and the Angel of the Lord with a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening stroke have smitten her on the side, and bid her rise quickly? And may not her chains, at that voyce fall off, and she gird her loins, and get her out of her bondage? <hi>Scotland's</hi> sicknes discovered it self, and for twelve years her issue, or fountain of blood hath been opened,<note place="margin">Mark 5.</note> and she hath suffered many things of many Physicians, and spent all that she had, and is nothing bettered, but rather the worse; her touching other garments and garbs, hath not healed her. Oh that now she would try in faith, what a
<pb facs="tcp:204719:13"/> touch of Christ will do! It may be, the fountain of bloud would be dryed up, and she might feel in her self, that her plague was healed. For which, and all our mercies to this people, shall, with the endeavours be joyned the requests of</p>

            <p>Let's take terms as they lye, and see how other Scriptures do explain them, and make Scripture its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which will be most safe for all persons to go by.

That there was an effectuall work wrought in the hearts of these my Text speaks of, I judge will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear, by comparing with my Text, these Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.20, 21.22, 23. — which <hi>when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus: and the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of them believed, and turned to the Lord. The tidings of these things came to the ears of the Church which was at Jerusalem, and they sent forth</hi> Barnabas, <hi>that he should go to Antioch, who when he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204719:15"/> came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost.</hi> The next verse tells us, that he found out <hi>Saul,</hi> and brought him to this Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they abode a whole year: and these Converts first called Christians. <hi>Barnabas</hi> is here said to be a man full of the Holy Ghost, and therefore able to taste his Communion, what divine recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was made amongst them, and heart answering to heart; and he and <hi>Paul</hi> together in a whole years time, might be competently able to give a judgment what they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these first Christians; and I think 'tis very dangerous to say, that as far as they could apprehend, these first Christians had not both name and thing, for which commended, and in which by these worthies joyed in: In particular Churches, some competent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204719:16"/> judgement may be made of every particular Member, by able men, in a long tract of time; and so are these Worthies elswhere said, with this Church, to have had intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.27, 28. <hi>And from thence sailed to</hi> Antioch, <hi>from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work which they fulfilled. And when they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. And there they [abode a long time] with the disciples.</hi> Add to this <hi>Act.</hi> 15. where you shall see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is solemnly asserted of thess Converts in several verses, as <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>And God which know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Compare with this, v. 11.16, 17, 18, 19. what he concludes, <hi>Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles, are turned to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus painfully and plainly laid the foundation by the Word, and by a simple and sincere judgement thereupon, without the least respect to any party, or self-interest in the world, as he knowes to whom in this as in all my wayes, I desire humbly to refer my self. I build thereupon this doctrine, <hi>That the proper and allowed matter of a visible Church now in the dayes of the Gospel, is persons truly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204719:17"/> converted, such as God, who knoweth the hearts of all men, can bear witnes of, as indeed sealed for his, by his Holy Spirit.</hi> I say, this is the matter we ought now to take, to raise again the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and none other, not one other, no not in a whole Church, so far as men truly converted, and very spirituall, are able to discern and judge. The particular Text I would cite for the further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this (that you may see how richly the Scripture consents to this) are these, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. v. 26, <hi>And when</hi> Saul <hi>was come to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>he assayed to joyn himself to the Disciples, but they were [all] afraid of him</hi> (by which it seems, they were a homogeniall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, under the same light and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and tendernesse in this matter) and believed not that he was a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.

But it is evident, that they feared that he did but meerly professe, and that they should take in a hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniall piece, one that had but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of that qualification which this new building should have; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Barnabas</hi> took him, and brought him to the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Upon the whole, this I collect, that persons meerly professing the things of God, are not approved and allowed matter by the Lord in a visible Church, they are such as he doth not measure, embrace for his Building, they are such as are fit to destroy, not to build the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Another shadow or hint of this truth, see <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. which whole Chapter is taken up to shew the state of the holy City forementioned. And in the first verse, observe whether <hi>John</hi> is taken to have the frame of this new building given to him. <hi>After this I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a Trumpet, talking with me, which said, Come up hither and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204719:22"/> very near Heaven, with which compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. But <hi>John</hi> hath his Patern given him in Heaven, to shadow, that this Temple, Altar, Worshippers, should all indeed be from above, and such as should have indeed an internall consecration, and the Law given into the minde, as the Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> saith, and made <hi>Jews</hi> inwardly, a holy Nation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to inward choise and call, and so a Spirituall Priesthood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not the way which I most minde to make Probation by, of this Point. I would prove it by induction. The Church of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Collossians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Thessallonians,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> which are mentioned by <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and the Author to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> were all thus constituted, with Persons
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204719:23"/> truly Godly, so far as a godly man can make judgement of one like himself, <hi>Ergo.</hi> If these be denyed, as Presidents, then I would ask our Brethren of the Presbytery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what rule they walk? But if these be confessed as Presidents, then I have onely to shew unto you, that these Churches did all thus constitute, though I think, did not long carefully keep and maintain this pure constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which bore their judgment, and yet do. What the Church of the <hi>Romans</hi> was, read <hi>Paul,</hi> who surely was able to discern in Spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and who surely durst not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement with Persons in things of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall concernment. <hi>Among whom ye are the called of Iesus Christ, to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be Saints, grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank God for you,</hi> [All] <hi>that your Faith is spoken of throughout the whole world, for God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204719:23"/> is my witnesse, that I make mention of you alwayes in my Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot think that a Faith of so high esteem with <hi>Paul,</hi> and of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown through the Christian world, and the matter of such fervent Prayer, should mean onely a temporary faith: Some of these were such as laid down their necks for <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16.4. The rest surely endangered their own necks, every day by their Profession, living in the mouth of that Tyrant <hi>Nero</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> cals him, or Dragons, as <hi>John</hi> calls all the Heathen Emperours of that place.</p>
            <p>If this be accompted but litle, yet many litles put together, amount to much. Adde therefore to this, the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

            <p>For the Churches of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> you have in part heard already, how the first Church, to wit, at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> constituted, and upon what terms they stood with <hi>Paul:</hi> which first Church gave the first Copy to all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, what to do, and (I think) held their own best, till their scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by persecution, which God orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the encreasing of the Churches of Christ, both amongst <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> But what all the <hi>Jewish</hi> Churches were in this thing for their Members, and how they did build their houses to God, see 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. with which compare <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.22. —<hi>and was unknown by face to the Churches of Judea which were in Christ.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:204719:25"/> And whether this was onely in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession? see, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>For this cause thank we God without ceasing, because when ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God, which effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally also worketh in you which believe. For the brethren became followers of the Church of God, which in Judea are in Christ Jesus, for ye have also suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like things of your Countrey-men, even as they have of the Jewes, who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets, and have persecuted us,</hi> &amp;c. The Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were such Professors of Christ, as endured persecution, sharp trials for the truth, and were eminently exemplary to the Christian World this way, as indeed Profession then did generally expose unto, though now not, and so volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Profession then, signified a great deal more, then that forced Profession of the Gospell, which now we make,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204719:25"/> under such powers as call for, and countenance these things, doth; which should be observed and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, which compare profession then with profession now, if they dealt equally in this controversie.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that there were wicked persons in these Churches which you have mentioned, therefore we may constitute visible Churches now in the dayes of the Gospel, with good and bad, with truly good and seemingly good, such as make only a profession, though we cannot discern the power of Religion in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I answer, <hi>à facto ad jus non valet argumentum,</hi> because such things are, therefore they ought to be, will not hold. Because bad men were in the Churches, the generall State of which in such a time of the World <hi>John</hi> speaks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1.2. therefore they should be there, will not follow, for then why is <hi>John</hi> bid to cast out that which is without,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204719:26"/> and not measure it, not embrace it: What is allowed to abide, is rather the Index, shewing what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and allowed matter, the true constitution and complexion of Church State, now in the dayes of the Gospel. Churches may be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and not so strict to their rule, to examine and prove the grace of God in such as offer to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto them, as the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did: If Churches do not minde diligently their rule, to look well who they adde to them, and how congruous in weight to the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary, they may have evill persons amongst them enough, and yet not be able to maintain that it should be so. T'is like that the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, and most of the first Churches, quickly after the Apostles time, grew faulty in this kinde, opened the door wider then they had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for, by which corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and for which God turned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204719:26"/> them all out of his house, as defiling of it. Or Churches, though very diligent and duly strict in this matter, yet are not infallible, and therefore hypocrites may deceive a Church for a time, and so get in where they have no right to be; The Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> doth confess so much, verse 4. of his Epistle: <hi>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> Not only persons may thus creep into the Church, but also creep into office, and still escape the first judgement upon them, made by the Churches, of which they are. The Apostle doth intimate this to <hi>Tim. Lay hands suddenly on no man,</hi> and observe his charge, which may make a man tremble to read. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things, without prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one before another, be not partaker of other mens sins, keep thy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204719:27"/> self pure; for some mens sins are open before hand, going before to judgement, and some they follow after.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, 22. We are as appears by this, compared with other Scriptures, to use all care, as much as in us lies, to prevent by the first judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, all that are not godly, from coming into a State, to which they are not approved by God, but if men by their subtilty creep in, as the serpent into the garden, where they should not be: we are to cast that out which is without, whilest within by the after judgement of the Church, which is excommunication, when it doth evidently appear that men are hypocrites, though not drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, and such kind of bodily sinners, as I may say, which is far less, simply considered, then hypocrisie; which after judgement, is an ordinance to cleanse the house of God and keep it pure, and according to what it ought to be, and doth strongly confirm the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204719:27"/> point that I am upon, that the matter of a visible Church, now in the dayes of the Gospel, should be reall Saints, the proper and approved complexion of a visible Church is sanctity, saving grace, and not one known to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, can justifiably enter or abide within Gods Holy hill.</p>
            <p>This truth I humbly conceive, hath strong appearance of reason in it, that the matter of a Church, should be men truly turned to God: for, how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise can there be uniformity in the Church, the thing so much desired and admired?

Christ doth argue from this <hi>medium,</hi> that suitable to the foundation should be the building; or otherwise, such incongruous super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions will be fired, and they which make them. — <hi>As a wise builder</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have laid the foundation, and another builds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

            <p n="2">2.

Let a man make up his offring of never so much worth and cost, yet still tis in the accompt of God as the man is: If the man be impure, so is his offering. With this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204719:30"/> compare 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ye also as lively stones, are built up a spirituall house, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sacrifice, acceptable to God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> Wherefore it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures, that I lay a suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundation to such a superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, meaning Christ. The stones must be living, to make a spirituall house, how else can the society be a holy Priesthood, to offer up spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, holy and acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. This place doth confirm, that the foundation and superstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is one, and that the Offering and the Offerer are one. To make the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering spirituall, holy, acceptable to God, the person that doth offer must be thus.

            <p>The matter of a visible Church

By the glory and Purity of his Worship, and Worshippers. See for this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. In the foregoing verses, the Prophet tels us of sore bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: and this to cast out filth and rubbish out of the Christian World. <hi>The Lord will come with fire, and with his Chariots like a whirle-wind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of fire, for by fire and by his sword shall the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many, they which sanctifie themselves, and purify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the gardens, behinde one tree in the midst, eating swines flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse shall

No: They shall also bring <hi>all your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>for an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Lord, out of all Nations, upon Horses and in Chariots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whither shall they bring them? Why
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204719:32"/> to my holy mountain of Jerusalem,</hi> saith the Lord. <hi>For as the New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the New Earth, which I shall make shall remain before me;</hi> By which observe, that this <hi>New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of the Gospel Churches is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, to be pure and to remain, as pure things last. And observe further, so shall the <hi>Jews</hi> which these pure Heavens shall provoke, — <hi>So shal your seed, and your name remain:</hi> And both joyned together into one pure Church: For that read verse 23. <hi>And it shall come to passe, that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me, for their worme shall not die, neither shal their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh:</hi> Which last words, ah let men read, and with much dread lay to heart, which make
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204719:32"/> light of these things we are upon: Mens Carcases will fall as formerly <hi>Israels</hi> did, for their froward walking, and the pure Church and people of God shall go forth and look upon these corrupted, and rotten Carcases, and give the Lord the glory of his Justice. Impurity of Worship, and Worshippers, provokes God, not the Jews: Tis that which stumbles them at this day, as I have heard from some of their own. God will hold up an exact glory to them, therefore is he exactly punishing the Christian world, to cast out every thing that offends: We have our private quarrels in our expeditions into Nations; Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not let us alone, saith one Nation to another, and the like; but God hath under all this, a design and quarrell by himself, which we are few of us aware of, and that is by the Sword, to cast out that which is without, to throw filthy things to their place, that he may have a pure
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204719:33"/> people, an an exact glory to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his ancient People, which when brought in, such Churches as are thus pure, such New Heavens shall be joyned to this new Heaven, and remain with this, as a Pillar in this great House, to go no more out, as is said of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> that pure Church; other Churches shall be destroyed by the hour of temptation, which there is spoken of. <hi>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world, to try them which dwel upon the earth: Behold I come suddenly, Rev.</hi> 3.10. Now when this hour of temptation shall be, see <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. to wit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly preceding the call of the <hi>Jews. And at that time shal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael stand up, the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people, and there shal be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation, even to that

When I compare these Lines with those in M. <hi>Rutherfurds</hi> Epistle to the same Book, I tremble indeed, viz. <hi>If I lift up my hand, or bloudy pen against the truly Godly, or have a pick at Holinesse, let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, I would answer thus; that there is difference between a cause and an occasion. That we walk in any fundamentall Truth in the power of it, many take occasion from hence to scoff, break forth into much wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse: What now? Is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Truth which we follow, or must we leave following it, because many take occasion from hence, to run out into all evill. At light hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out in every age of the World, Satan hath this way (when he could no other way) laboured to darken it, by extracting poison out of honey and the honey comb. As in the beginning of its looking out of the bottomlesse pit of blindnes, when some of the first Fathers began to lay again that great principle and fundamental of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Divell to darken this, set a-foot <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were bloudy enough; but when this would not do, the Divell spread their Tenent, that the whole Heavens
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204719:40"/> were darkened (as it were) with these Locusts. After this, when some of the modern Fathers, laid that great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall point of Justification by Faith in Christ, to darken this, the Divel conjured up your Anabaptist in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> a generation much like your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers and Ranters now, which deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Propriety, Magistracie, all indeed which was good, and by this made great Insurrections and troubles, as History abundantly shewes. Now in this period of time, God hath made another accession of light, respecting the roof and up-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt of the House, and now what stirs, dusts, mists fogs doth the Divell exhale! Why, what now? Is all therefore darknes drosse, because the Divell thus maketh many abuse this season, and the helps and grace which is come unto them? I think things about which the Divell doth make such ado, may rather be thought to have something in them, rather then from hence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204719:41"/> they have nothing of God in them; because the Divell doth not usually set against his own, doth not divide against the Divell. When this new Heaven, as the Prophet calls it; when this new Order, respecting Gods House, was first set up at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> what bloody stirs it made there.

                  <p>BUt I see no reason at all from the context, why it should be thought, that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Representive, of one kinde or other, should be here meant; their <hi>conventus judicum,</hi> or their <hi>conventus Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastici;</hi> for, there is nothing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going or following, that gives any leaning language, this way: but, much to insinuate and signifie, that he speaks of that Church, which should speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take place, to wit, the order of the Gospel Church: for he speaks in the verse foregoing of little ones, which he explains to be true Believers, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204719:53"/> converted ones, v. 6. and v. 3. And this is made the qualification of the visible members of the New Church, in the Chapter foregoing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. Then the very words of censure, in case the Church should be disobeyed, are the same with those he useth to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he gave the Keys to him upon his Fath, — <hi>Whatsoever ye binde on earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. And just thus saith he to <hi>Peter</hi> ch. 16.19. <hi>And I will give unto thee the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,</hi> &amp;c. So that the one explains the other; that by Church, is not meant the Presbytery, or Eldership of one kinde or other, but the Gospel Church, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Beleevers; these <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim</hi> have the Power to censure and cast out, according to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>VVhen you are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to deliver such a one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> &amp;c. And by the same joynt power received in again, that as his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204719:54"/> was by many, so his consolation and reception might be <hi>by many</hi> also; as tis 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. that Satan might take no advantage; which is enough to shew, how that admission of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers should be a joynt Act of the Church, as well as excommunication of Members.</p>
                  <p>The contrary to this understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these and such like places, serves either to maintain an Episcopal power over the Church, which is all one with the Papall; or else an usurpation like unto it by the Presbytery, in managing all things without the people, which in effect comes all to one, that the people in all publick censures, admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are but meer spectators of what is done, which is the very doctrine and exposition of the Jesuits of <hi>Rhemes</hi> upon that place fore-cited: See <hi>Rhem.</hi> Annot. on 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.4. with their marginall Notes; And so by a circular motion, we shall come from the Papall to the Episcopall, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204719:54"/> from the Episcopall to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, and from the Presbyteriall to the Papall power again, of depriving the people of God of their best Liberties, in matters so much concerning them, there being little ods under whom they have the same bondage, whether they be brought in bondage by one Prelate, or by many Presbyters; who as they take power to themselves without the Word, may justly have the same title, with other usurpers and Lords over the flock of Christ.</p>

                  <p>TAke common testimony to this truth: In the first times this was so well known, and so frequent in practice, to take in the joynt suffrage of the Congregation, in all matters of greatest weight: That Bishop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> himself, one that wanted not wit, nor learning, nor any other helps, and setting all his strength to maintain these contrary to what we are upon, yet is constrained to confess, that in the Apostles times, the state of the Church was Democraticall, or Popular; the people or multitude having a hand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every thing, <hi>Whitgifts defence</hi> p. 182. Which word <hi>almost,</hi> doth well suit the thing I am upon, and indeed speaks, that he saw much light in this matter, though he could not receive it in love; for indeed, as I have said, in all weighty matters, all the body did bear their joynt voice to the transaction
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204719:58"/> thereof, as hath bin before proved. And whal else meaneth that Canon, that was made in the Councel at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> 330. years after Christ, that the people after that, should have no hand in the choise of their Officers, unless former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was. So <hi>Caranza Epitome,</hi> page 59. By which common testimony, it appeareth, that when Metropolitans, and Bishops, and Superintendents sprung up, that then the Liberties of the People were by degrees taken from them, one with this device, and tother with that invention, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had, which should make the children of these, more willing to repent of, and restore again, then yet, ah alas! words, works, blowes, bloods of body and soul will make them: how low, O Lord, shall we be, ere we lay to heart whom we have so long robbed and spoiled, and whose dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place we have so great a time polluted and laid waste!</p>

Now it cannot be thought in reason, that the Apostle would appoint him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, otherwise then he himself did ordain; but he himself ordained by the suffrage of the people, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished them by the help of their fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. And this is all which is left upon record, for direction in this matter, as yet we can find, and therefore this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> must and did follow, and then the truth is still abiding, which I have laid down: That Elders cannot in weighty things of the Church, move determinately, without the Church.

The <hi>incestuous person</hi> was not onely
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204719:61"/> among the Elders but the people, and they are bidden to cast him out, as well as the other; to exert office, or degrade from office; this I call an essenciall or fundamentall power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is that in which the being of the Church consists, and is a right, not in one individuall, but in many individuals, as united in one Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, fellowship, or society, as a concret body: and of this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall power I have all along spoken, and this belongs equally to all. But then there is an organicall power, which is, <hi>Potestas officii particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> which is that by which every one keeps his place and rank, one as an eye, another as an hand, another as a foot; some as leaders, others as followers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some to judge, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to declare, act, and exercise that judgement in the name of the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is the God of Order; and because we know that it is confusion for all to speak at once, Pray at once:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204719:61"/> This latter, to wit, an organical power, is proper to each officer, and not to the whole. The power of judging of Members to be admitted, is common to the whole Church, Elders and Fraternity; The manner of managing this, and exerting this judgement to the knowledge and desire of him that assayes to joyn himself to the Church, is peculiar to office, so may it be said of the rest: The former is a power lying formally in many conjoyned, and not in any one: The latter is a power derived from many, and lying formally in one, and not in many, and for those particular resultive works forementioned; and so is their power distinctly usefull and significative, and not uselesse and nothing from the whole.</p>

But there was nothing here done, but any one of them might have done it. And as for the concurring Elders of other Churches, they could not have this, being the first and onely Gospel-Church
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204719:66"/> extant. Tis true, this whole Church concurred and accepted him upon whom the lot fell: but here was no joynt voices and suffrages of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and Elders, and chosen Brethren of many Congregations, which is the thing to be proved, to give forrain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership footing in this place; that they should be a combination of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Elders to severall particular Churches, which these were not, but generall Officers.</p>

And that we may be clear and full in answer to this place, this must first be premised; That, though it be true, that the Apostles as such, were extraordinary Officers, yet that in this act and meeting, they did not thus move; my reason is this, because in the power of extraordinary assistance, and under the spirit of infallible help, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers do not, nor need not, joyn ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Churches and Officers (as here was) in their consultations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries: officers and brethren, here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, enquired, each man had allowed liberty, to propound his doubts, urged the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7, 8, to 18.

                  <p>FRom hence therefore this may be collected, that the sentence, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or decree which was issued from this meeting, was not therefore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Canonicall and binding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they decreed it, as it still was, when the Apostles moved by the proper spirit of their Apostolicall station, according to that 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Holy men of God, spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost.</hi> But what they decreed, was by debate found out, to be expresse in the Scripture, or undeniably deducted from thence, and so by one of these wayes was found to be Scripture, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore decreed and enjoyned by them upon others, as the industry of these worthies in those decrees, gave their own evidence. And thus do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men judge, is that phrase to be understood. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, v.</hi> 28. By the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204719:68"/> Holy Ghost then must be either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, the immediate Revelation of the Spirit, parallel to that of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and this the Text admits not; for there was no extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that can in reason be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or conceived to belong to the ordinary multitude. Or else it must be the Holy Ghost, as speaking in the Word, which latter is most manifest to be the meaning, because things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted by them, follow by infallible inference from the Scriptures as the Will of the Lord, and other by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Text, as that of fornication.

First, these decrees are said to binde those to whom they are sent; And 'tis evident, they were sent to all the Churches of the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.25. <hi>As touching the Gentiles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we have written and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they observe no such thing, save onely that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from bloud and from strangled, &amp; from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi> Now these had no commiss. nor else of that kind delegated to that Synod, and therefore what they did there, could not binde them by way of any authoritative jurisdiction: where then is no delegation of messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by mutuall consent, there is no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204719:70"/> right of jurisdiction. Now not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by jurisdiction, it must needs be, that they did bind these Gentiles by way of such preheminent counsel, &amp; as such things which in themselves were clearly held out to be Gods minde and will: that here they did acquiesce, and did not further meddle with any juridicall processe upon them, appears by those pacifick words, which would they were written not with ink and pen, but with the Spirit of the Lord upon all Prerbyters hearts, who are so turbulent in these times — <hi>From which if you keep your selves, ye shal do well. Fare ye well.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. SEcondly, that this sojourning Eldership did exercise onely a power of Counsell, is evident by this further circumstance of reason; the controversie being onely between the Parties which met in the same counsel; For tis said that they which were for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204719:70"/> Circumcision so hotly, came down from <hi>Judea,</hi> and it may be were some that did apostatize, and fall to serve the times, to judaize as <hi>Peter</hi> did at this same Church of <hi>Antioch, Gal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>But Peter when he was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed, &amp;c.</hi> But it is evident that one side in the counsel was a party, to wit, them of <hi>Antioch;</hi> Now for this Church, which was a party, and contested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their opposites in a fair way, to be judge in their own cause, and to be juridical upon their antagonists by their own power, cannot equitably nor conscionably be imagined.</p>

                  <p>ANother place of much account to this purpose, and frequently urged by our Brethren is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, with the laying on of the hands
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:204719:71"/> of the Presbytery.</hi> Here seems to be two things, a sojourning Eldership, or a collegiat Church, which did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain <hi>Timothy,</hi> and so a sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and an exempted authority from the people, by which this great act was done, both which indeed, if they did clearly appear from this place, much of our Brethrens work were done in a little compasse. But as to this place, I have spoken before something in handl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng the first Assertion. Here I may repeat and adde a little. This El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership or Presbytery here mentioned could not be an ordinary Eldership, such as consisted of ordinary Pastors &amp; Teachers, and brethren commissioned from severall particular Churches: My ground I have before given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an ordinary Eldership cannot institute an extraordinary officer, as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, to wit an Evangelist; and then not being an ordinary Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but an Eldership onely of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary officers, not precisely from
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204719:71"/> such and such particular Churches, but such as were equally of all, as of any one, 'twill not amount to the nature of a Patern and binding presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to build upon.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus pursued the first <hi>medium,</hi> I come now to the next. <hi>That a coercive Eldership, out of the particular Congregation, is a device of man,</hi> for it opposes the Word. For the Scriptures give in their Testimony, nor one or two, though these were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but in plenty, that what power of ruling jurisdiction, <hi>potestate judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii, donationis,</hi> or the like, an Eldership hath, it hath it in the same extent it hath its Pastorall power, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Yea, that an officers Pastorall power, exceeds in extent his ruling power, rather then his ruling power exceeds his Pastorall power in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. To extend a Pastors pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordinary ruling, beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his ordinary teaching, is against
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:204719:72"/> the order which Christ hath set, and so against the Scripture, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a sojourning ruling Eldership, doth oppose the Word: That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Church Officers power to rule is no further then the extent of his place, to feed, instruct, and diffuse knowledge and Doctrine, appears by these Scriptures. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed to your selves, and to all the flock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ver which the Holy Ghost hath made you over-seers, to feed the flock of God, which he hath purchased with his own bloud.</hi> There were many officers belonging to this Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> some (no doubt) of one kind, some of another, but 'tis manifest here, they were but one flock: And the limite of these is observable, and how, and by what squared, to over-see, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. THirdly, a sojourning coercive Eldership, is surely a device of man, &amp; no instituted ordinance of God, because it eludes that end, to which it would seem to pretend, which kind of <hi>medium's</hi> God doth not make, unless we should charge him with ignorance and folly, which were blasphemie to do: What instruments and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he makes and consecrates to any end, they are adequate and exquisite to produce it. That which forrain Elderships pretend to (in their several ranks of subordination and preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one lower or higher then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204719:75"/> is, an effectuall remedy of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that nothing may be undone, or ill done, as to the relief of any ones complaint, or as to the appointing of any one his right, or any society their right, &amp;c. But now these sojourning Elderships, whilst thus pretending and giving out to the World, do like the Lapwing, draw off Travellers from their Nest, and from their young: my meaning is, from looking into their nakednesse: it takes off people from looking after that which indeed fits, and upon Scripture-grounds may warrant means unto such ends. To say, that we have so many Learned men in our Synods, and Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and Church-Commissions, which are more able to search into things, and to judge of things, then a private Eldership of a Congregation is, to hold out mans wisedome to people, and an arm of flesh, which much takes poor people, yea, and much prevails upon flesh and blood, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204719:75"/> of greater parts, and so indeed is a gaudy Snare. Let Ministers, Doctors, Lords, who will, be in a sojourning Eldership, men of never so much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet the Eldership of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is like in reason, to be more learned in the busines of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Members which offend, then stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, because they are eye witnesses of persons and things, and have by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>BUt secondly, tis good to enquire wisely into this matter, as <hi>Solom.</hi> saith, What is an institution of God, unto such an end; If the power at home in the particular Congregation, be the institution of God for its own affairs, this shall discern better, and judge better, and heal better, then all the Learned Assemblyes in the World,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204719:76"/> which people litle look after, whilst this great noise is made, with men of so great parts and worth, which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing Presbyteries assemble withal. Thirdly, in the nature of the thing, tis a course which cast those which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, upon a multiplication of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and references forth and back; from the Session to the Synod, from the Synod to the Generall Assembly; and when the poor Traveller is there, he is turned over to the Commission of the Kirk, and when come there, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back again, may be, to the General Assembly; and whether this looks like Scripture ordinance, or like the thing it pretends to, an effectuall removall of burden and offence, whilst it thus worryes poor people up and down, let Christians judge: This is <hi>nequid detrimenti capiant capita Ecclesiae:</hi> the truth is, this whole frame and <hi>series,</hi> looks more like to entangle and perplexe poor creatures, then effectually to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat

                  <p>FInally, because the particular Church is compleat without them: for God would not appoint uselesse things. Every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation rightly constituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated hath sufficiencie within it self, to exercise all the ordinances of Christ; to ordain, to excommunicate, without forrain Elderships of what degree so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204719:77"/> have ability &amp; power given to it, as to such a great end; they have not a lame Commission, part of the Keyes at their girdle, and strangers and forrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers carrying the other part.

Have the Eldership that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many Churches, the sufficiencie of their State from hence, that they are

Or if the forme be right, that there be such a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular company of Saints combined and united, to walk in all the wayes of God together, and to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The bad wil cast out the good, sooner then they wil condescend to cast out themselves, when the power is in their own hand, as that it must stil necessarily be, whilest the major part by far, in all ranks, is the worst: So that Church State is in this case, quite dead; 'tis not a man but a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case; not a Church, but a nest of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean birds, a den of theeves: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to depart from the dead is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; But to talke of purging the dead, where there is not a foundation to

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> IF protesting were onely words▪ then such a thing would do. But to say the precious should not mingle with the vile, and yet the man doth thus dayly &amp; continually, is not to protest but to mock, and dissemble; because here is not a pure passiveness in this man, as to the going on of that thing which he protests against. Again, in practical things, tis not so much a mans word as his practice, which gives the dislike. If a man of an idolatrous Church, should stand up &amp; protest against the Masse, and yet still go to Masse, I doubt how well this would please God, or deliver him from guilt. <hi>Naaman</hi> implicitely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests against the idolatry he had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, that he would worship no God, but the God of Israel: and did he continue to bow down?
